The `graphql.GraphQL` bean can be defined by solely using the https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java[GraphQL Java] implementation,
or in combination with other integration libraries like https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-tools[GraphQL Java Tools]
or https://github.com/leangen/graphql-spqr[GraphQL SPQR]. As mentioned before the first one is added as transitive dependency, other
integration libraries must be added to the classpath manually.

Below is a typical example of a Micronaut https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html[Factory] class
configuring a `graphql.GraphQL` https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Bean.html[Bean] using the
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java[GraphQL Java] library.

snippet::io.micronaut.graphql.docs.GraphQLFactory[tags="imports,clazz", project-base="docs-examples/hello-world", source="test"]

<1> Define the `Factory` annotation to create the bean.
<2> Define the `GraphQL` bean which contains the runtime wiring and the executable schema.

There are various https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graphql/tree/master/examples[examples] using different technologies
provided in the repository.
